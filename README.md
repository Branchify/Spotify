## Overview
### Description
Branchify offers users the ability to upload their favorite Spotify playlists and select a number (n) of branches by which they would like to expand their taste in music. It then generates a playlist of the top song of the recommended artist iterated n times for each originally featured artist.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Music Discovery
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would be just as viable on a computer. Functionality is not bound solely to mobile devices, as Spotify offers a Web Player as well.
- **Story:** Analyzes users' playlist composition and generates a new playlist with the top songs of artists recommended to the preferred degree.
- **Market:** Any individual interested in expanding their music taste in a unique manner would choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how much interest they have in discovering new music, as well as the number of playlists they have and the breadth of their existing music taste.
- **Scope:** First we would start with offering users their own personalized, "branches" playlist, then perhaps this could evolve into a playlist sharing application as well to broaden its usage. Users could eventually be able to rate their interest in the suggested artists in order to offer the social community high-satisfaction group content. There is large potential for use with spotify, apple music, or other music streaming applications.
